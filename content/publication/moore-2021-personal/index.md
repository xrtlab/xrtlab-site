abstract: Recent research indicates that user tracking data from virtual reality
  (VR) experiences can be used to personally identify users with degrees of
  accuracy as high as 95%. However, these results indicating that VR tracking
  data should be understood as personally identifying data were based on
  observing 360° videos. In this paper, we present results based on sessions of
  user tracking data from an ecologically valid VR training application, which
  indicate that the prior claims may not be as applicable for identifying users
  beyond the context of observing 360° videos. Our results indicate that the
  degree of identification accuracy notably decreases between VR sessions.
  Furthermore, we present results indicating that user tracking data can be
  obfuscated by encoding positional data as velocity data, which has been
  successfully used to predict other user experience outcomes like simulator
  sickness and knowledge acquisition. These results, which show identification
  accuracies were reduced by more than half, indicate that velocity-based
  encoding can be used to reduce identifiability and help protect personal
  identifying data.
