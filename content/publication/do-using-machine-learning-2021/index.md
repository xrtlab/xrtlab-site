abstract: League of Legends (LoL) is the most widely played multiplayer online
  battle arena (MOBA) game in the world. An important aspect of LoL is
  competitive ranked play, which utilizes a skill-based matchmaking system to
  form fair teams. However, players' skill levels vary widely depending on which
  champion, or hero, that they choose to play as. In this paper, we propose a
  method for predicting game outcomes in ranked LoL games based on players'
  experience with their selected champion. Using a deep neural network, we found
  that game outcomes can be predicted with 75.1% accuracy after all players have
  selected champions, which occurs before gameplay begins. Our results have
  important implications for playing LoL and matchmaking. Firstly, individual
  champion skill plays a significant role in the outcome of a match, regardless
  of team composition. Secondly, even after the skill-based matchmaking, there
  is still a wide variance in team skill before gameplay begins. Finally,
  players should only play champions that they have mastered, if they want to
  win games.
