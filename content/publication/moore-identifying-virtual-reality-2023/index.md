abstract: Recently, there has been much interest in using virtual reality (VR) tracking
  data to authenticate or identify users. Most prior research has relied on task-specific
  characteristics but newer studies have begun investigating task-agnostic, domain-specific
  approaches. In this paper, we present one of the first systematic investigations
  of how different combinations of VR tracked devices (i.e., the headset, dominant
  hand controller, and non-dominant hand controller) and their spatial representations
  (i.e., position and/or rotation as Euler angles, quaternions, or 6D) affect identification
  accuracy for domain-specific approaches. We conducted a user study (n = 45) involving
  participants learning how to assemble two distinct fullscale constructions. Our
  results indicate that more tracked devices improve identification accuracies for
  the same assembly task, but only headset features afford the best accuracies across
  the domainspecific tasks. Our results also indicate that spatial features involving
  position and any rotation yield better accuracies than either alone.
