abstract: Virtual reality (VR) researchers have had a long-standing interest in
  studying locomotion for developing new techniques, improving upon prior ones,
  and analyzing their effects on users. To help organize prior work, several
  researchers have presented taxonomies for categorizing locomotion techniques
  in general. More recently, researchers have begun to conduct systematic
  reviews to better understand what locomotion techniques have been
  investigated. In this paper, we present our own systematic review of
  locomotion techniques based on a well-established taxonomy, and we use k-means
  clustering to identify to what extent locomotion techniques have been
  explored. Our results indicate that selection-based, walking-based, and
  steering-based locomotion techniques have been moderately to highly explored
  while manipulation-based and automated locomotion techniques have been less
  explored. We also present results on what types of metrics have been used to
  evaluate locomotion techniques. While usability, discomfort, and travel
  performance metrics have been moderately to highly explored, other metrics,
  such as biometrics, user experience, and emotions, have been less explored.
