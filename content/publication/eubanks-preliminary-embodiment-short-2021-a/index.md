abstract: "Consumer virtual reality (VR) technologies have made embodying a
  virtual avatar during an immersive experience more feasible. The sense of
  embodiment toward that virtual avatar can be characterized and measured along
  three factors: self-location, agency, and body ownership. Some measures of
  embodiment have been previously proposed, but most have not been validated or
  do not measure the three individual factors of embodiment. In this paper, we
  present the construction and validation of a preliminary version of a short
  questionnaire that not only addresses these factors of embodiment but can also
  be used as an in-VR questionnaire, which we call the pESQ. By using and
  validating the pESQ, we provide results indicating that foot tracking
  significantly improves self-location and agency, and that an avatar
  significantly improves body ownership."
