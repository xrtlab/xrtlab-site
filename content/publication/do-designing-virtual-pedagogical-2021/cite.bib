 abstract = {The use of virtual and augmented reality for educational purposes has seen a rapid increase in interest in recent years. Extended reality offers unique affordances to learners, and can enhance learning. Specifically, we are interested in the use of pedagogical agents in extended reality due to their potential to increase student motivation and learning. However, the design of pedagogical agents in extended reality is still a nascent area of study, which can be important in an immersive environment where social cues can be more salient. Pedagogical agent design aspects such as speech, appearance, and modality can prime social cues and affect learning outcomes and instructor perception. In this paper, we propose a project to investigate auditory and visual social cues of pedagogical agents in XR such as speech, ethnicity, and modality.},
