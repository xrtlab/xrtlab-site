abstract: The use of virtual and augmented reality for educational purposes has
  seen a rapid increase in interest in recent years. Extended reality offers
  unique affordances to learners, and can enhance learning. Specifically, we are
  interested in the use of pedagogical agents in extended reality due to their
  potential to increase student motivation and learning. However, the design of
  pedagogical agents in extended reality is still a nascent area of study, which
  can be important in an immersive environment where social cues can be more
  salient. Pedagogical agent design aspects such as speech, appearance, and
  modality can prime social cues and affect learning outcomes and instructor
  perception. In this paper, we propose a project to investigate auditory and
  visual social cues of pedagogical agents in XR such as speech, ethnicity, and
  modality.
