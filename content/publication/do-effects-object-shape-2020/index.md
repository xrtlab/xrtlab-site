abstract: Depth perception of objects can greatly affect a user's experience of
  an augmented reality (AR) application. Many AR applications require depth
  matching of real and virtual objects and have the possibility to be influenced
  by depth cues. Color and luminance are depth cues that have been traditionally
  studied in two-dimensional (2D) objects. However, there is little research
  investigating how the properties of three-dimensional (3D) virtual objects
  interact with color and luminance to affect depth perception, despite the
  substantial use of 3D objects in visual applications. In this paper, we
  present the results of a paired comparison experiment that investigates the
  effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception of
  3D objects in handheld mobile AR. The results of our study indicate that
  bright colors are perceived as nearer than dark colors for a high-fidelity,
  simple 3D object, regardless of hue. Additionally, bright red is perceived as
  nearer than any other color. These effects were not observed for a
  low-fidelity version of the simple object or for a more-complex 3D object.
  High-fidelity objects had more perceptual differences than low-fidelity
  objects, indicating that fidelity interacts with color and luminance to affect
  depth perception. These findings reveal how the properties of 3D models
  influence the effects of color and luminance on depth perception in handheld
  mobile AR and can help developers select colors for their applications.
