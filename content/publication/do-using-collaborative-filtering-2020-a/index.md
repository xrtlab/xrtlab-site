abstract: League of Legends (LoL), one of the most widely played computer games
  in the world, has over 140 playable characters known as champions that have
  highly varying play styles. However, there is not much work on providing
  champion recommendations to a player in LoL. In this paper, we propose that a
  recommendation system based on a collaborative filtering approach using
  singular value decomposition provides champion recommendations that players
  enjoy. We discuss the implementation behind our recommendation system and also
  evaluate the practicality of our system using a preliminary user study. Our
  results indicate that players significantly preferred recommendations from our
  system over random recommendations.
