abstract: "Training simulations in virtual reality (VR) have become a focal
  point of both research and development due to allowing users to familiarize
  themselves with procedures and tasks without needing physical objects to
  interact with or needing to be physically present. However, the increasing
  popularity of VR training paradigms raises the question: Are VR-based training
  assessments accurate? Many VR training programs, particularly those focused on
  inspection tasks, employ simple pass or fail assessments. However, these types
  of assessments do not necessarily reflect the user's knowledge."
