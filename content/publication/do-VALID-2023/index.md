abstract: As consumer adoption of immersive technologies grows, virtual avatars
  will play a prominent role in the future of social computing. However, as
  people begin to interact more frequently through virtual avatars, it is
  important to ensure that the research community has validated tools to
  evaluate the effects and consequences of such technologies. We present the
  first iteration of a new, freely available 3D avatar library called the
  Virtual Avatar Library for Inclusion and Diversity (VALID), which includes 210
  fully rigged avatars with a focus on advancing racial diversity and inclusion.
  We present a detailed process for creating, iterating, and validating avatars
  of diversity. Through a large online study (n=132) with participants from 33
  countries, we provide statistically validated labels for each avatar's
  perceived race and gender. Through our validation study, we also advance
  knowledge pertaining to the perception of an avatar's race. In particular, we
  found that avatars of some races were more accurately identified by
  participants of the same race.
