abstract: Modern text-to-speech engines can be an effective speech choice for embodied
  virtual pedagogical agents. However, it is not known how synthesized accents influence
  learning outcomes and perceptions of the agent. In this paper, we conducted a between-subjects
  experiment (n=60) to determine the effect of a pedagogical agent's machine synthesized
  text-to-speech accent (United States English or Indian English) on learning outcomes
  and perceptions of the agent for students in the United States. Our results indicate
  that learner gender interacts with synthesized speech accent to significantly affect
  learning outcomes and perceptions of the agent. Our results reveal that a foreign
  synthetic speech accent may affect the learning outcomes of female university students
  (n=30), but not male university students (n=30). Finally, our results indicate that
  learner gender interacts with synthesized speech accent to affect perceptions of
  the pedagogical agent's human-likeness. We provide novel insights on the differences
  between male and female learners for interactions with pedagogical agents with synthetic
  TTS accents.
