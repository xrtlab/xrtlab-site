I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida (UCF). My research interests focus on improving Presence measuring instruments for virtual environments and designing interaction cue systems for guidance Virtual Reality (VR) applications.

I have worked previously as a Software Engineer at Microsoft and have held multiple internship positions throughout my academic career.
