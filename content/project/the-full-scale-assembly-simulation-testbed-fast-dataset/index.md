We present a new open dataset obtained from conducting a large user study (n = 46, approximately gender balanced) involving participants learning to assemble multiple full-scale structures in VR and then recreating the structures in real life. The Full-scale Assembly Simulation Testbed (FAST) dataset includes input features such as the positions and rotations of the VR headset and controllers, interactions, and assembly steps. FAST also includes response variables such as demographics, simulator sickness, presence, VR task performance, and, uniquely, real-life training transfer measures. In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of FAST and its potential applications for future researchers.

Dataset is associated with the publication [Identifying Virtual Reality Users across Domain-Specific Tasks: A Systematic Investigation of Tracked Features for Assembly](/publication/moore-identifying-virtual-reality-2023/).
