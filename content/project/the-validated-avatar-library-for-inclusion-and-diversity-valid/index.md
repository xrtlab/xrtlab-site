The UCF and Google *Validated Avatar Library for Inclusion and Diversity (VALID)* consists of 210 fully rigged and **perceptually validated** virtual avatars designed to advance diversity and inclusion. The library features avatars of seven different races (American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN), Asian, Black, Hispanic, Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI), and White), providing a diverse selection for researchers to use in their studies. The validated labels can facilitate research on the impact of avatar race, and researchers can choose to use the labels for studies aimed at individuals from different racial backgrounds or same-race labels for specific study populations. Avatars were created using a process that combined data-driven average facial features with extensive collaboration with representative stakeholders from each racial group.
