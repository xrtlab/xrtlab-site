Point clouds are a 3D space representation of an environment that was recorded with a high precision laser scanner. These scanners can suffer from environmental interference such as surface shading, texturing, and reflections. Because of this, point clouds may be contaminated with fake or incorrect colors. Current open source or proprietary tools offer limited or no access to correcting these visual errors automatically. RecolorCloud is a tool developed to resolve these color conflicts by utilizing automated color recoloring. We offer the ability to deleting or recoloring outlier points automatically with users only needing to specify bounding box regions to effect colors. Results show a vast improvement of the photo-realistic quality of large point clouds. Additionally, users can quickly recolor a point cloud with set semantic segmentation colors.
